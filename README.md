# Nominal MSBR cases

- See \*nominal\*.inp for nominal MSBR reactor conditions taken from Cammi with
the exception of the critical buckling height (since we are currently in
disagreement).

- Compare serpent\_2g\_res.m and
  calc\_height\_and\_xsecs\_with\_provided\_critical\_buckling.out to see very
  nice agreement between macrosopic cross sections and k<sub>eff</sub> of 1.
